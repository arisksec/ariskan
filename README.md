# ariskan

**ariskan** is an advanced Reconnaissance Framework designed for **legal and ethical security testing**.
Its main purpose is to automatically gather as much information as possible about a web target in order to identify potential areas of weakness.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

The framework operates in multiple stages:

1. **Target Discovery** *(Finding the Doors)*
   Locate and identify active targets within the specified scope.

2. **Information Gathering** *(Checking the Locks)*
   Collect critical details about the target’s infrastructure, technologies, and services.

3. **Content Discovery** *(Jiggling the Handles)*
   Enumerate hidden files, directories, and resources that may reveal sensitive information.

4. **Vulnerability Pattern Detection**
   Identify patterns that could indicate the presence of known vulnerabilities.

## 🎯 Purpose

In short, **ariskan** automates the **first crucial phase** of a security assessment.
It builds a **detailed map** of the target and **flags interesting areas**, allowing a security professional to focus manual testing efforts on the most promising spots.

## ⚠️ Legal Notice

This tool is **strictly for authorized testing only**.
Using **ariskan** on targets without prior permission is **illegal** and could lead to severe consequences.
Always ensure you have **explicit written consent** before running any tests.
